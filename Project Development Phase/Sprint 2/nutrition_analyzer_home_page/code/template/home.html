            <p>Food is essential for human life and <br>has been the concern of many
                healthcare <br>conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment<br> and
                nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people
                understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and
                maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of
                determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of
                analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical
                composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food. It
                ensures compliance with trade and food laws.
